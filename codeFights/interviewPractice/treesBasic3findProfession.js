/*
Consider a special family of Engineers and Doctors. This family has the following rules:

Everybody has two children.
The first child of an Engineer is an Engineer and the second child is a Doctor.
The first child of a Doctor is a Doctor and the second child is an Engineer.
All generations of Doctors and Engineers start with an Engineer.
We can represent the situation using this diagram:

                E
           /         \
          E           D
        /   \        /  \
       E     D      D    E
      / \   / \    / \   / \
     E   D D   E  D   E E   D
Given the level and position of a person in the ancestor tree above, find the profession of the person.
Note: in this tree first child is considered as left child, second - as right.

Example

For level = 3 and pos = 3, the output should be
findProfession(level, pos) = "Doctor".

Input/Output

[execution time limit] 4 seconds (js)

[input] integer level

The level of a person in the ancestor tree, 1-based.

Guaranteed constraints:
1 ≤ level ≤ 30.

[input] integer pos

The position of a person in the given level of ancestor tree, 1-based, counting from left to right.

Guaranteed constraints:
1 ≤ pos ≤ 2(level - 1).

[output] string

Return Engineer or Doctor.

function findProfession(level, pos) {
    let isEngineer = true;
    while(--level) {
        if (pos % 2 === 0) {
            isEngineer = !isEngineer;
        }
        pos = Math.ceil(pos/2);
    }
    return isEngineer ? 'Engineer' : 'Doctor';
