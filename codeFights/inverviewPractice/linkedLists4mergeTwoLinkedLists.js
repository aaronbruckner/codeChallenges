/*
Note: Your solution should have O(l1.length + l2.length) time complexity, since this is what you will be asked to accomplish in an interview.

Given two singly linked lists sorted in non-decreasing order, your task is to merge them. In other words, return a singly linked list, also sorted in non-decreasing order, that contains the elements from both original lists.

Example

For l1 = [1, 2, 3] and l2 = [4, 5, 6], the output should be
mergeTwoLinkedLists(l1, l2) = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
For l1 = [1, 1, 2, 4] and l2 = [0, 3, 5], the output should be
mergeTwoLinkedLists(l1, l2) = [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
Input/Output

[execution time limit] 4 seconds (js)

[input] linkedlist.integer l1

A singly linked list of integers.

Guaranteed constraints:
0 ≤ list size ≤ 104,
-109 ≤ element value ≤ 109.

[input] linkedlist.integer l2

A singly linked list of integers.

Guaranteed constraints:
0 ≤ list size ≤ 104,
-109 ≤ element value ≤ 109.

[output] linkedlist.integer

A list that contains elements from both l1 and l2, sorted in non-decreasing order.
